# newton_second_law_simulator_js
Simulator of Newton's second law for a 2D projectile in a gravitational field, a spring oscillating in the y-direction, and an object undergoing uniform circular motion.

Simulation runs on page load and when start/reset buttons are clicked. Green arrow represents acceleration vector and red arrow represents velocity vector. Created using the p5.js JavaScript library.
